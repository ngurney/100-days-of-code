# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on changing my personal site from static to responsive. 

**Thoughts:** I really learned a lot. I have been focusing so much on learning new things, and practicing less which has been detrimental. I found it great to actually just dig into the code and learn by trial and error. Debating about redesigning the app.
